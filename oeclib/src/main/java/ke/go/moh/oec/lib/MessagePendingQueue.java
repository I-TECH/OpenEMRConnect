/**
 * Mechanism to wait for a response to a message.
 * When sending a message for which we expect a response, the message
 * is put in a pending queue. Then as messages are received they are
 * compared against the pending queue entries to see if they are a response.
 * <p>
 * The request thread will wait to see if a response comes. If it comes,
 * the request thread will be woken, and the response will be returned to
 * the caller. If no matching response comes, a timer will time out and
 * wake the request thread. It will then return with no matching response.
