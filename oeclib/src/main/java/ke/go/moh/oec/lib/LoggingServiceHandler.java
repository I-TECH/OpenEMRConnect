     * Publishes a LogRecord.
     * <p>
     * The logging request was made initially to a Logger object, which initialized the LogRecord and forwarded it here.
     * We send the record off to the Logging Server (if it is important enough.)
     * <p>
     * Programming note: we want to avoid recursion if anything is logged while we are sending
     * the log record to the Logging Server. In that case, we don't want to try
     * sending this message to the Logging Server also (stack overflow!)
     * To prevent recursion, we look at the stack to see if we are on it.
     * More precisely, we start from the third element of the stack -- because
     * the first element is always from the Thread.getStackTrace() method, and
     * the second elements is always from us, as the caller of Thread.getStackTrace().
     * But if we appear again at a higher level of the stack trace, that means
     * that we have called ourselves recursively. If this happens we will not
     * try to send the message to the Logging Server.
