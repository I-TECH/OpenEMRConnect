/**
 * Calls the user's registered callback routine for an unsolicited message.
 * This is done in a separate thread, so the HTTP response to a request
 * can be returned as soon as the server starts processing the request.
 * This prevents HTTP response timeouts from the application that made the request.
 * <p>
 * It also can prevent new HTTP requests from being rejected if the request thread pool
 * should run out because the threads are busy processing requests. This is unlikely,
 * but it is best to do any resource-intensive HTTP request processing
 * on a separate thread.
 * <p>
 * When the callback routine finishes the application-level request,
 * the application-level response will be sent back on a new HTTP request message.
