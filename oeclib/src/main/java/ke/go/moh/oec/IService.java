 * This interface is used for passing data requests and responses between the

 * For server software, this interface is implemented by the server object
 * that will receive the request. If user software is only making client
 * requests, it need not implement this interface.

     * Request data through the service interface.
     * <p>
     * A client calls the getData method of the OEC library. In the library,
     * this method will take the request, package it into a HL7 message, and
     * deliver it to the server.
     * <p>
     * On the server side, this method is also implemented by the server software
     * object that will receive the request.
     * When the OEC library receives a request destined for this server, it
     * unpacks the HL7 message, and delivers it to the object's getData method.
     * To accomplish this, the server first registers the object to receive
     * requests using {@link ke.go.moh.oec.lib.Mediator#registerCallback}
     *
     * @param requestTypeId type of request; constant from class {@link RequestTypeId}
